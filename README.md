# Non-Linear-Classification--Matlab

Double Moon Classification using a multi layer neural networks at different distances between the two half moons.Three different algorithms are used for classification namely Back Propogation,Back Propogation with Momentum and Levenberg Marquardt.

# Training
Training was done with three different learning rates of 0.1,0.01 and 10 and the number of hidden neurons of 10,50,100 for all three algorithms and for three different inputs.

# Decision Regions

One of the decision regions for Levenberg Marquardt Algorithm with d=-8.Network trained with learning rate 0.01 and 10 hidden neurons
